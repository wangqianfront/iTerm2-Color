## Installation

### Theme

The theme is based on the wonderfully made [ys](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/ys.zsh-theme) theme from the official [oh-my-zsh repo](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

1. Drop [`honukai.zsh-theme`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oskarkrawczyk/honukai-iterm/master/honukai.zsh-theme) into the `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` directory
2. Change the theme variable name to `ZSH_THEME="honukai"` in `~/.zshrc`
3. Reload ZSH with `source ~/.zshrc`

### Colors

1. Open **Preferences** pane on the **Profiles** tab in iTerm
2. Switch to the **Colors** tab and import the [`honukai.itermcolors`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oskarkrawczyk/honukai-iterm/master/honukai.itermcolors) (drop-down in the lower right corner)

**NOTE**: You'll need at least iTerm2.9-nightly (aka 3.0)
